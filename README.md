## 👩‍💻 For Developers

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deftorch/colorvariants.git
cd colorvariants
./gradlew build
```

Output JARs: `fabric/build/libs/` and `forge/build/libs/`

### Development Setup

```bash
# Run Fabric development client
./gradlew :fabric:runClient

# Run Fabric development server
./gradlew :fabric:runServer

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Generate coverage report
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

### Project Structure

```

### Architecture

This mod uses the **Service Locator pattern** for platform abstraction:

```java
// ✅ Correct: Platform-agnostic in common/
Services.PLATFORM.getPlatformName();
Services.REGISTRY.registerItem("color_wand", ...);

// ❌ Wrong: Direct platform API in common/
FabricLoader.getInstance().getEnvironmentType();
```

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Service Locator (platform abstraction)
- Strategy (color transforms)
- Observer (network synchronization)
- Memento (undo/redo system)
